                    <h2>Summer</h2>
                    <p class="text">Summer in Finland is a glorious season that typically spans from June to August. It's a time when the country experiences long daylight hours, with some areas in the north enjoying the phenomenon of the Midnight Sun, where the sun doesn't set for several weeks.

                        The weather is at its most pleasant during the summer, with temperatures ranging from 15 to 25 degrees Celsius (59 to 77 degrees Fahrenheit) on average. This makes it an ideal time for outdoor activities and enjoying the natural beauty of the Finnish landscape.
                        
                        Many Finns have summer cottages near lakes or in the countryside. It's a tradition to spend weekends and holidays at these cottages, enjoying saunas, swimming in the lakes, and cooking meals over open fires.
                    
                        Summer is the season for numerous music festivals, cultural events, and outdoor concerts that draw both locals and tourists.

                        Finns embrace the outdoors during summer. Activities like hiking, biking, fishing, kayaking, and boating are popular. National parks and nature reserves are perfect for exploration.</p>

                    <p class="text">    In a nutshell, Finnish summers are a time of outdoor adventures, relaxation by the water, and vibrant cultural festivities. It's a season when the beauty of the Finnish landscape truly shines, and the country comes alive with activity and celebration.

                    <h2>Autumn</h2>
                    <p class="text">Autumn in Finland is a breathtaking season that typically spans from September to November. It's a time of significant natural transformations, as the lush green landscapes of summer transition into a kaleidoscope of vibrant red, orange, and yellow hues.

                        As the temperature drops, trees across Finland begin to change colors, creating stunning displays of autumn foliage. I really really love this season, the roads are lined with rows of trees changing yellow leaves, and the weather is pleasantly cold, creating a scene worth remembering with all your heart.
                        
                        Autumn is the prime season for foraging mushrooms and berries in Finnish forests. Many Finns head into the woods to collect these natural treasures, which often find their way into delicious meals. I also go into the forest and pickup the blueberry to make jam and juice, I even store them in the freezer and use in the winter.

                        Some other activities in autumn like hiking, go sauna,... are popular. With me, the autumn in Finland is still my favourite season in year.

                    <h2>Winter</h2>
                    <p class="text">Winter in Finland is a breathtaking, snow-covered wonderland that typically lasts from December to February, although it can extend into March. This season transforms the country into a magical landscape where various activities and traditions are deeply rooted in the Finnish way of life.

                        Finland becomes a picturesque winter wonderland with pristine white snow covering the landscape. Snowfall is common, creating a serene and enchanting atmosphere.

                        Finns embrace winter with enthusiasm, participating in a variety of outdoor activities. Cross-country skiing, ice skating, snowshoeing, and snowmobiling are popular pastimes. The country's extensive network of trails and frozen lakes provides ample opportunities for these sports. </p> 

                    <p class="text">   Winter is one of the best times to witness the mesmerizing Northern Lights (Aurora Borealis) in the northern regions of Finland. Clear, dark nights offer optimal viewing conditions for this natural spectacle. I haven't had a chance to see the aurora yet, but that will come true in the future.
                        
                        Some activities popular in winter are skiing and snowboarding, ice fishing, sauna and ice swimming, Christmas market, sledging and tobogganing are also funny. 

                        While winter in Finland can be cold and dark, it's a season of enchantment, adventure, and embracing the unique beauty and culture that comes with the snowy months. The resilience and joy with which Finns embrace winter make it a truly special time in the country.
