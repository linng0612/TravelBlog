            <h1>An unexpected journey</h1>
            <p class="text">I had a memorable trip in 2023 to Thiruvananthapuram (or Trivandrum), it is the capital of the southern Indian state of Kerala. Thank you Prabu for taking us around, and for a fun and safe trip. Before coming to India, I heard many rumors that it would be unsafe, the food was difficult to eat, the hygiene was not good, etc. But the surprising thing was that things were not quite like what people out there  thought about India, at least with me.</p>
            <p class="text">The Indians I met were really very friendly, they welcomed and helped us very enthusiastically. When we visited the village of Prabu, we were greeted by the ceremony of distinguished guests arriving in the village with a large wreath of roses around our necks, which was truly something difficult to describe.
                
                Regarding hygiene, even though they use their hands to prepare and eat food, I personally do not feel uncomfortable about it, on the contrary, I find this experience very interesting. For them, food is a precious thing that God has given them, so they will use their right hand to receive it respectfully. They also do not waste food.
                
                The food here is really what makes me nostalgic, from the notion that Indian food is difficult to eat, to enjoying its special flavor, and now I still occasionally look for Indian restaurants to visit.</p>

            <p class="text">Therefore, if you have the opportunity, remove your prejudices and come to India to explore more about this land. I will come back here again, maybe go to the North to experience more authentically Hinduism, its majestic palaces and temples. See you one day not far away.</p>
